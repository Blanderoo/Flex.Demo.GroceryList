# Flex Review: JavaScript & DOM

## Demo: Grocery List

In this demo, you will be creating a grocery list where you can add itmes to the list, complete items, and delete items.

### Requirements

- The HTML does not contain any hard-coded data about grocery items
- Use `document.querySelector`
- The program initializes a state with grocery list and completed items
- A function is written that correctly calculates the total price of all the items on the grocery list
- The DOM is updated to reflect the total price
- When the "delete" button is clicked, the item is deleted from the list
- When the "completed" button is clicked, the item is crossed off
  - Extra: Put the completed, crossed-off item at the bottom of the list

### Extra

- When the "sort" button is clicked, the items are sorted by category
